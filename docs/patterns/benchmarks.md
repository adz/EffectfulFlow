# Benchmarks

This page shows the performance tradeoffs of using FsFlow compared to manual composition across the runtime shapes it supports.

The benchmark harness lives in [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Suites.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Suites.fs) and the shared helpers live in [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Common.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Common.fs).
The Fable runner lives in [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/Program.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/Program.fs) and shares its workload definitions from [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/Shared.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/Shared.fs).
The Fable benchmark project is self-contained by source inclusion, so it can be compiled directly with Fable against the library code in [src/FsFlow](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/tree/main/src/FsFlow). Its local tool manifest lives in [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/mise.toml](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/mise.toml), with [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/package.json](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/package.json) for Node ESM execution and [scripts/run-fable-benchmarks.sh](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/scripts/run-fable-benchmarks.sh) for the target-specific runner.

The implementation split matters:

- [src/FsFlow/Core.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/Core.fs) defines `Effect<'value, 'error>` and flips its concrete shape by compiler target.
- [src/FsFlow/Flow.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/Flow.fs) exposes `Flow.run`, which returns that `Effect` on both .NET and Fable.
- [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Suites.fs](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/Suites.fs) shows the manual baselines beside the `Flow` versions.
- [scripts/run-benchmarks.sh](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/scripts/run-benchmarks.sh) prompts before starting the .NET benchmark run so you can stop other processes first.

## Summary

- `Flow` stays competitive with manual `Result`, `Async<Result<_,_>>`, and `Task<Result<_,_>>` composition
- the .NET effect shape is `ValueTask<Exit<'value, 'error>>`
- the Fable effect shape is `Async<Exit<'value, 'error>>`
- the same benchmark source can be reused across .NET, Node, Erlang, and any other supported Fable backend

## Setup

Recorded .NET measurements in this repository were taken with:

- .NET SDK 10.0.201
- .NET runtime 10.0.5
- F# 10.0
- BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8

The current repo toolchain also builds with .NET SDK 10.0.203, .NET runtime 10.0.7, and F# 10.0. The benchmark source does not change between those toolchains.

## Runtime Coverage

Each runtime should show the same comparison:

| Runtime | Without Flow | With Flow | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .NET | `Result`, `Async<Result<_,_>>`, `Task<Result<_,_>>`, and raw `Task` baselines | `Flow.run` returning `Effect<'value, 'error>` | Measured with BenchmarkDotNet |
| Fable on Node | manual `Result` and reader composition | `Flow.run` returning `Async<Exit<'value, 'error>>` | Run through `scripts/run-fable-benchmarks.sh` |
| Fable on Erlang | manual `Result` and reader composition | `Flow.run` returning `Async<Exit<'value, 'error>>` | Run through `scripts/run-fable-benchmarks.sh` |
| Other supported Fable backend | manual `Result` and reader composition | `Flow.run` returning `Async<Exit<'value, 'error>>` | Use the same benchmark source whenever a backend is available |

The Fable runner uses the same benchmark source on each backend, with the sync-result and reader-propagation comparisons shown below for Node and Erlang. The other-backend row is the same runner shape, ready for any additional Fable target that becomes available.

## .NET Results

The measured .NET run in this repository used:

- .NET SDK 10.0.203
- .NET runtime 10.0.7
- F# 10.0
- BenchmarkDotNet 0.15.8

The tables below are taken from the joined BenchmarkDotNet report for the current tree.

### Reader Overhead

| --- | --- | --- |
| `Manual env passing x10` | 74.02 ns | 80 B |
| `TaskFlow localEnv x10` | 256.06 ns | 560 B |
| `AsyncLocal updates x10` | 819.32 ns | 2,000 B |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Direct Async<Result>` | 1 | 7.048 us | 1,000 B |
| `AsyncFlow` | 1 | 8.907 us | 7,977 B |

### Cancellation

### Composition Chain

### Synchronous Completion

| Method | Mean | Allocated |
| --- | --- | --- |

| `TaskFlow` | 258.24 ns | 752 B |
| `Ply vtask` | 209.37 ns | 128 B |

The practical read is unchanged: `Flow` stays competitive with the direct baselines, and the extra cost is a fixed orchestration cost rather than a function of the actual business logic.

## Fable Results

The Fable runner is built from the source-included benchmark project in [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable.fsproj](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable.fsproj) and uses the toolchain pins in [benchmarks/mise.toml](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/mise.toml) plus [benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/mise.toml](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.Fable/mise.toml).

## Conclusion

- use FsFlow for architectural clarity and safety
- expect some orchestration overhead even for local reader and synchronous composition
- treat Fable BEAM async as the highest-cost case in these microbenchmarks
- keep the runtime comparison tied to the actual target backend, because the `Effect` shape changes between .NET and Fable
- use the benchmark source links above when you want to inspect how the manual and `Flow` implementations differ

## Benchmark Map

The actual benchmark suites and the method pairs they compare are:

- `ReaderOverheadBenchmarks`: `ManualEnvPassingX10` vs `TaskFlowLocalEnvX10`
- `AsyncRailwayBenchmarks`: `DirectAsyncResult` vs `AsyncFlow`
- `TaskRailwayBenchmarks`: `DirectTaskResult` vs `TaskFlow`
- `CompositionChainBenchmarks`: `FlowMapX100`, `FlowBindX100`, `AsyncFlowBindX100`, `TaskFlowBindX100`, `DirectAsyncResultBindX100`, `DirectTaskResultBindX100`, `RawTaskBindX100`
- `CancellationFlowBenchmarks`: `ExplicitTokenTaskResult` vs `TaskFlow`
- `CancellableTaskBenchmarks`: `ManualTokenTask` vs `IcedTasksCancellableTask`
- `SynchronousCompletionBenchmarks`: `CandidateValueTaskFlow` vs `TaskFlow`

The .NET benchmark report is generated from `FsFlow.Benchmarks`; the Fable runner is separate and uses the same comparison vocabulary without pretending the runtime shape is the same.
