Use the `result {}` computation expression when you have a sequence of steps where each step depends on the previous one, and you want to **stop at the first failure**.

This is "fail-fast" semantics.

## Basic Usage

The `result {}` builder binds standard F# `Result<'value, 'error>` types.

```fsharp
type UserError = | MissingName | MissingEmail

let validateUser name email =
    result {
        // If name is blank, it returns Error MissingName and stops.
        let! validName = name |> Check.notBlank |> Check.orError MissingName
        
        // This line only runs if the name was valid.
        let! validEmail = email |> Check.notBlank |> Check.orError MissingEmail
        
        return { Name = validName; Email = validEmail }
    }
```

## Guarded Bindings

`Guard` is a powerful companion to `result {}`. It allows you to bind boolean or check-shaped sources directly while attaching an error value at the binding site.

```fsharp
let login username password =
    result {
        // If password is blank, fails with MissingPassword
        do! Check.notBlank password |> Guard.Of MissingPassword
        
        // If user not found, maps the underlying error to Unauthorized
        let! user = tryGetUser username |> Guard.MapError (fun _ -> Unauthorized)
        
        return user
    }
```

## When to use `result {}`

- **Sequential Dependencies**: When Step B requires the output of Step A.
- **Fail-Fast**: When continuing after an error makes no sense (e.g., you can't save a user if the email is invalid).
- **Simple Logic**: When you only need to return a single error value to the caller.

If you need to collect *multiple* independent errors at once, use [`validate {}`](../validate-ce/) instead.
