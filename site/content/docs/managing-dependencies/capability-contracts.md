In FsFlow, a capability is a named interface that describes what a flow needs from `env`.
A capability contract puts that interface in the environment surface type.

Using an interface through a capability contract makes the dependency visible in the type, so the
compiler can check it, refactoring can move safely, and reusable helpers can advertise what they
need.

This page is for readers who want the dependency surface to be part of the type:

- the record is getting too wide
- the dependency list is becoming boilerplate
- you want the compiler to notice when a refactor changes what an effect needs
- you want the effect signature to read like a dependency statement, not a plumbing report

The contract should be small, named, and stable. When it grows, split the bundle into runtime and
app slices or move the boundary back to a concrete record.

## The Contract

```fsharp
type IClock =
    abstract UtcNow : unit -> DateTimeOffset

type ILog =
    abstract Info : string -> unit

type IDb =
    abstract Query : string -> string

type IRuntimeCaps =
    abstract Clock : IClock
    abstract Log : ILog

type IAppCaps =
    abstract Db : IDb
```

The contract is the interface surface, not the lookup mechanism.

## Reading Through The Contract

Use the contract directly from workflows and helper functions.

```fsharp
let getTimestamp : Flow<#IRuntimeCaps, unit, DateTimeOffset> =
    flow {
        let! clock = Flow.read _.Clock
        return clock.UtcNow()
    }
```

In practice, the contract often comes from an adapter-generated host type or a concrete record
that implements the interface.

## Why Use A Contract

Capability contracts give you:

- compiler checks on the dependency surface
- refactor safety when a helper changes what it needs
- workflow signatures that read as “this effect needs logging, clock, and db”
- reusable helpers that advertise what they depend on
- programming to interfaces, but for effects

That makes effects visible in the flow without forcing every boundary to become a big record.
If the boundary is already obvious, a record already gives you direct access. A contract adds a
type-level name that the compiler checks and that helpers can reuse across flows.

## What A Record Gives You

A record gives you:

- a short dependency list with direct fields
- a boundary that stays local to one area
- a shape that is easy to reuse as data
- no extra interface for a structure that is already simple

## What A Contract Gives You

A contract gives you:

- the same dependency shape named once and reused across flows or helpers
- compiler errors at the call site when a dependency changes
- a flow that advertises its capabilities directly
- a readable type instead of a long parameter bag

## Binding Tokens

`Requires<'dep>`, `Resolve<'dep>`, and `Resolve<'dep, 'value>` are the binding tokens FsFlow uses
to name a dependency at the projection boundary.

These tokens project a single service from `env` and keep the lookup shape explicit in the type.

## What A Named Contract Gives You

A named contract gives you:

- a helper shared across multiple areas
- a stable dependency shape with one name
- a signature that explains itself
- a reusable interface that justifies the extra type-level name

## When It Is Not Worth It

Do not add a named contract just to make the code look more abstract.

A record keeps a concrete boundary direct.
`RuntimeContext` separates your app services from the host runtime.
Standard `.NET` AppHost plus DI adapts the container once at the host edge.

## What This Replaces

The current shape is simple:

- a concrete record boundary
- a small nominal interface
- `RuntimeContext<'runtime, 'env>` for separating your app services from the host runtime
- `Flow.read` or `Flow.readRuntime` / `Flow.readEnvironment` to project values from the contract

See the [Capability reference](../../reference/capability/) for the binding tokens, the
runtime/app readers, and the layer surface.
